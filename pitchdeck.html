            A satirical gameshow in which two manic female best friends co-opt
            the genre and reimagine it as distinctly millenial, critical and relevant.
            Contestants compete in a series of absurd mental and
            physical challenges designed to make you laugh so hard
            you forget to cry.

            THE FUTURE IS 0 is a live game show set in a glitzy, showbiz
            dream world. Contestants compete in a series of challenges designed to
            explore themes that plague our current times: gentrification, technology and alienations,
            authenticity, discrimination and labor.

            The games are at once asinine and oddly touching, like "Isolation Sation", where
            a contestant is trapped inside a studio apartment and must answer questions about loneliness and isolation in order
            to win points. In another, contestants are workers in "Tech Co's" fulfillment center and must tear through
            cardboard shipping boxes as they move down an assembly line to find an elusive, golden health insurance card.

            FUTURE is hosted by Clay Buff, an out of touch, egomaniacal soothsayer. Clay considers herself a Hollywood hot shot,
            but in reality she can barely keep it together. Standing in the wings of the show delicately orchestrating each segment
            is Kat, her overworked producer who holds it all together. When Clay falsely insists that everyone in the audience is going home
            with a brand new Segway, Kat is there to rebuke her, publicly apologize, and keep the show on track.

            Funny and sad and compassionate all at once, THE FUTURE IS 0 elevates the mundane and the serioes
            to the same level, and hits them against each other until you're laughing so hard you forget to cry.

            Contestants and games change each episode, but through the arc of a full season, viewers
            witness Clay and Kat's anxiety-fueled relationship to the show, current events and each other in
            the context of a shiny and surreal game show set. The show is thematically centered around millenial
            malaise, but with a core that is genuine, heartfelt, and hopeful.

            Across the span of a season, the series builds on itself by calling back recurring segments and gimmicks,
            and through the development of Clay and Kat's characters, tension and friendship. During the season we gradually
            learn of the existence of a monolithic corporation called Tech. Co that not-so-secretly funds and runs the show,
            much to Clay's chagrin. Viewers are invited to enter the bizarro world of FUTURE through the mutual delight and
            bafflement of the contestants and studio audience, who are continually surprised with insane gimmicks, cameos, and
            outrageous props.
